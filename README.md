# HiveMP.OpenData

Here at HiveMP, we collect and aggregate publicly available data such as Steam statistics and social media posts. This React-based web frontend allows you to explore the data stored in our public BigQuery datasets, using your own Google Cloud billing account.

If you are a HiveMP customer, you can browse these datasets through your own account via the web console, rather than being billed for BigQuery usage by Google directly.

This is still a work-in-progress.
